**`Vietnamese kid | Data Science | Triathlon | Barber | Do Good Things`** 

I’m currently a Junior 👨🏼‍🎓 at Hobart and William Smith Colleges studying Computer Science and Data Analytics. I’m just a Vietnamese kid who doesn’t know much about this field, but always curious to apply data-driven decision makings into daily life. My philosophy is doing things that make me move forward, and embrace getting lost as a part of the process, because good things take time. 

I’m leaning toward Data Science as I’m working on Dough Flow— A web app that forecasts sales for a local bakery in Pen Yann, New York. I have no knowledge in Machine Learning or Streamlit, but I believe learning along the way is better than waiting to be ready to start something.

I’m training for a IRONMAN 70.3 🏃🏻 🚴🏻 🏊🏻‍♂️ for next summer. This sport helps me find myself, be a better person, and show people that they can do what I do as well. GO ONE MORE!
